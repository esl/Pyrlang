Pyrlang - Erlang node in Python
===============================

This is a drop-in Erlang node implementation in Python 3, implementing
a network Erlang node protocol. It was designed to allow interoperation between
existing Python projects and BEAM languages: Erlang, Elixir, Alpaca, Luaerl,
LFE, Clojerl and such.

With just a few lines of startup code your Python program becomes an Erlang
network node, participating in the Erlang cluster.
